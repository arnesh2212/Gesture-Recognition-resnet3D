# Gesture-Recognition-resnet3D
Gesture recognition has gained significant importance in various fields, from human-computer interaction to healthcare and entertainment. This project aims to develop an advanced gesture recognition system using ResNet-3D, a powerful convolutional neural network architecture, to enable precise and real-time recognition of hand gestures in a 3D space.

This project uses Gesture Recognition Dataset: Jester - https://developer.qualcomm.com/software/ai-datasets/jester 
The Jester dataset was created with the help of more than 1,300 unique crowd actors.

Developers have successfully created classification models based on the training set and found that they perform well on the validation set. Running models on the test set, developers can achieve scores of up to 97 percent.

The video data is provided as one large TGZ archive, split into parts of 1 GB maximum. The total download size is 22.8 GB. The archive contains directories numbered from 1 to 148092. Each directory corresponds to one video and contains JPG images with a height of 100px and variable width. The JPG images were extracted from the original videos at 12 frames per seconds. The filenames of the JPGs start at 00001.jpg. The number of JPGs varies as the length of the original videos varies.

The model achieved 84% accuracy on the validation set.
The project's expected outcome is a robust and real-time gesture recognition system using the ResNet-3D architecture. This system will be capable of recognizing a wide range of 3D hand gestures with high accuracy and can be integrated into various applications, enhancing human-computer interaction and user experience
